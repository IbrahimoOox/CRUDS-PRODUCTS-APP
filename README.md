# CRUDS-PRODUCTS-APP
Product Management Web App
This is a simple web application built with JavaScript, HTML, and CSS that allows users to manage products using CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete). The app also provides search functionality by category and product name. Additionally, it includes a feature to calculate delivery costs, ads expenses, final product prices, and apply discounts.

Features
Create: Users can add new products by providing details such as name, category, price, and quantity. The app will generate a unique identifier for each product.

Read: Users can view a list of all products available in the system. The product list includes information such as name, category, price, and quantity.

Update: Users can edit the details of existing products, including modifying the name, category, price, and quantity.

Delete: Users can remove products from the system by deleting them.

Search by Category: Users can search for products by specifying a category. The app will display a filtered list of products belonging to the specified category.

Search by Name: Users can search for products by entering a partial or complete product name. The app will display a filtered list of products matching the search query.

Delivery Calculation: The app includes a feature to calculate the delivery cost based on the user's location and the weight or size of the product.

Ads Calculation: Users can input the advertising expenses for each product, and the app will calculate the total advertising costs.

Price Calculation: The app calculates the final price of each product by considering the base price, delivery costs, and advertising expenses.
